Hey what's up
- I'm currently studying computer science at university
- "currently working on"? passing my classes?
- Favourite and most capable (programming) language is Python. i love python. i eat syntactic whitespace for breakfast every morning.
  - unfortunately it seems that for that experience to be useful, I have to learn libraries now too. ugh.
- Vaguely interested in human languages, including my native 🇬🇧, 🇫🇷, 🇵🇱, 🇨🇳, 🇦🇺🧏, and 🇰🇭
